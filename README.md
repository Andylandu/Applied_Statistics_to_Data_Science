# Applied Statistics to Data Science
## This is a series of Statistics applied to Data Science in Python.
## At the heart of Statistics lies variability: measuring it, reducing it, distinguishing random from real variability, identifying various sources of real variability, and making decisions in the presence of it.
### This series is currently ongoing, so the code is being added by me, Andy Landu.
