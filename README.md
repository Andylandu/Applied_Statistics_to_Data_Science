# Applied Statistics to Data Science in Python
## This is a series of Statistics applied to Data Science in Python.
## "At the heart of Statistics lies variability: measuring it, reducing it, distinguishing random from real variability, identifying various sources of real variability, and making decisions in the presence of it." - by Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce from their book (Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 50 essential concepts)
### This series is currently ongoing, so the code is being added by me, Andy Landu.
